This Java program demonstrates how to copy an object using a copy constructor instead of the clone() method.

 What it does:
Creates a Human object with age and name.
Copies that object into another using a special constructor.
Modifies the copied object's age.
Prints both objects to show that changing one doesn't affect the other.

 Purpose:
To understand how object copying works in Java and how to create a copy constructor.

 Key concept:
Even though both objects have the same data, they are stored in different memory locations, so changes in one won't affect the other.
