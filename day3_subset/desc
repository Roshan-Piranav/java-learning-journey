Subset Generation using Recursion in Java
Today, I learned how to generate all subsets (also known as the power set) of a given string using recursion.

 Logic:

I used two strings:

p → the processed part

up → the unprocessed part

At each step, I either:

include the first character of up in p, or

skip it, and recurse further.

 Output:
This generates all possible combinations of the characters in the string "abc".
Result is stored in an ArrayList<String>
